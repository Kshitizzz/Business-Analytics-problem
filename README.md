Problem statement: A Quick Service Restaurant has 4 walk-in refrigeration units. There is an energy meter installed at power supply of each of the 4 refrigeration units. There is also 1 temperature sensor installed inside each of these. Attached is data for power (kW) and temperature (degree Celsius) for 4 energy meters and 4 temperature sensors for 10 days. Do a comparative analysis of following parameters and prepare a presentation. You are allowed to use any tool for the analysis.
	1.       Duty cycle
	2.       Set temperature range (lower threshold and upper threshold)
	3.       Average daily energy consumption
	4.       Percentage of temperature compliance
 
Notes:
	1.       Refrigeration units usually have a range of set temperature instead of a single set point where lower and upper thresholds are defined.
	2.       Ideal temperature range is defined as 1-4 degree Celsius. Percentage of temperature compliance is percentage times temperature is within ideal range.

Solution: Comparative Analysis.pptx

I have used Python and MS-Excel for analysis. Let me know if you need the ipynb and excel solutions also.
